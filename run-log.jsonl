Japan grocery category. Key lesson: Most popular Japanese products are already on Amazon US through importers or official channels.

Future runs should consider: 1) Less-covered regions (Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America), 2) Products mentioned in local forums vs tourist/expat forums, 3) Products with regulatory barriers (food, supplements) or cultural specificity."}
