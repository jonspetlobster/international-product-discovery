Japan grocery category. Key lesson: Most popular Japanese products are already on Amazon US through importers or official channels. Need to focus on truly niche/regional products, or products available at 3x+ markup. Minimal Wash Muro was only discovery - compact motorized washing device not yet imported to US. Future runs should consider: 1) Less-covered regions (Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America), 2) Products mentioned in local forums vs tourist/expat forums, 3) Products with regulatory barriers (food, supplements) or cultural specificity."}

FDA-blocked sunscreens emerged as strongest opportunity (8.7 score) due to massive demand and clear US regulatory gap. Also found Tamburins niche fragrance brand. Rejected several products now available on Amazon US (Aestura, sodium percarbonate, brass utensils)."}
