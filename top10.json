      "description": "A cult French pharmacy healing emulsion classified as a medication in France, trusted by hospitals and dermatologists for over 25 years. Contains trolamine in a unique oil-in-water emulsion that creates a moist healing environment for burns, wounds, radiation therapy skin reactions, and severe sunburns. The silky, lightweight texture absorbs quickly despite being intensely hydrating. Used in French hospitals for radiotherapy patients and recommended by oncology departments worldwide.",
