      "description": "Ultra-compact motorized washing device that attaches to any bucket, sink, or basin to wash clothes. Has 4 settings including delicate mode. USB-powered, weighs only 170g (6 oz), includes carrying bag. Designed for washing delicates separately or washing clothes while traveling without access to laundromats.",
      "problem_solved": "Hand-washing clothes is tedious and tiring; traditional portable washers are bulky and manual. Travelers, RV owners, and apartment dwellers need a compact, effective solution for small loads and delicates.",
      "us_gap": "US portable washers are either manual (WonderWash, bucket washers requiring physical effort) or bulky folding units. No compact, motorized, truly portable solution exists. Americans use manual agitation or large portable machines that defeat the purpose of portability.",
