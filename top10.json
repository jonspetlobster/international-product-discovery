US sunscreens use old chemical filters (avobenzone, oxybenzone) that are heavier, greasier, leave white cast, and only need to block 30% of UVA rays to be labeled 'broad spectrum.' Korean sunscreens solve this with modern filters that are cosmetically elegant and offer true broad-spectrum protection.",

      "description": "Vietnamese chili oil infused with lemongrass, garlic, and shallots. Unlike Chinese chili crisp (which is nutty and Sichuan-pepper forward), sa tế is citrusy, bright, and herbaceous from fresh lemongrass. Used as finishing oil for pho, bun bo hue, and as marinade for grilled meats. Vietnamese food bloggers say if you like chili crisp you will LOVE sa tế.",
